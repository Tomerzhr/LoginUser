Welcome dear visitor,
The next project is a login panel project which was created using Html, Javascript, Css.
This is a simple Javascript project that illustrates how you can connect or register to a website or service, all with the help of an accessible and intuitive design for the user.
The project contains validations that the user enters and thus moves him to the next field.
Also attached to this file are a number of users and passwords with which you can log in for the test.
I hope you will be impressed by my project and with any questions do not hesitate to contact me through my portfolio website.

Users that can be used to log in:

Email: admin1@gmail.com
passwords: Aa123456

Email: admin2@gmail.com
